I'm a recent CS grad (April '25) who believes the best way to learn is by building. Theory is cool, but shipping a real project is what gets me going. I love diving into the full stack, figuring out complex problems, and turning ideas into things people can actually use.

My journey so far has been a mix of professional work and a whole lot of "I wonder if I can build that..." projects. I've engineered a **Node.js backend for a commercial VR game**, taken on project delivery as a **Video Game Producer**, and even directed a **Startup Grind** chapter. I thrive on ownership and the challenge of seeing a project through from a blank file to a finished product.

Right now, I'm deep-diving into **serverless architecture on AWS (Lambda, API Gateway)** with **talentmapp** and exploring the practical side of AI with multi-tenant APIs using **NestJS and vector search**.

### ‚ú® Some Things I've Built

Here are a few of the projects I've spent my recent late nights on.

1.  üß† **TalentMapp (AI-Powered API & Platform)**
    *   A multi-tenant **NestJS** API using **OpenAI embeddings** and **MongoDB Atlas vector search**. The goal is to make talent search intelligent and subjective. Paired with a **Next.js** frontend.

2.  üëï **Fitbook (Full-Stack Solo Project)**
    *   My personal solution to "I have nothing to wear." A digital wardrobe and outfit planner built with Next.js, Prisma, and NeonDB. Built and shipped in 3 months. Check it out at **[fitbook.club](https://fitbook.club)**.
